      "**Types of Machine Learning**\n",
      "-----------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on labeled data to learn the relationship between input and output.\n",
      "2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on unlabeled data to discover patterns or relationships.\n",
      "3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.\n",
